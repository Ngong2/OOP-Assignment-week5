## 📄 README 2 – Vehicle Polymorphism Demo  

```markdown
# Vehicle Polymorphism Demo 🚗✈️🚤🚴

This project demonstrates **polymorphism in Python** using a base class `Vehicle` and multiple subclasses.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Base Class:** `Vehicle` with a `move()` method.
- **Polymorphism:** Different vehicle types (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`, `Bicycle`) override `move()`.
- **Unified Interface:** All vehicles can be used interchangeably in a loop.

---

## 📂 Classes

- **Vehicle** – Base class.
- **Car** – Prints `Driving 🚗`.
- **Plane** – Prints `Flying ✈️`.
- **Boat** – Prints `Sailing 🚤`.
- **Bicycle** – Prints `Pedaling 🚴`.

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the demo with:

```bash
python vehicle_demo.py
